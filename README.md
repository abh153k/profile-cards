A simple profile page with a card-stack effect.

## Inspiration

I found a few card stack effects on Dribbble, and tried to imitate it with HTML and CSS. You can find them [here](http://www.epiphanytek.com/css-cards/index.html#profile-cards). Spent a couple of hours with Figma and then sat down to code it.

It's not ready for anything. I just wanted to learn Figma. However, I learned several new things, most important being `position:absolute` breaks flexbox, grid and whatever other alignment you are using.
